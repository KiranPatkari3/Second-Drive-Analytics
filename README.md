**Second Drive Analytics**

Overview

Second Drive Analytics is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the resale value of used cars based on various factors such as mileage, age, brand, fuel type, and more. The project utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and deployment to provide accurate price predictions.

**Features**

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, duplicate entries, and feature engineering.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies trends and correlations in car resale prices.

- Machine Learning Model: Trained using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

- Web Application: Built using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users.

- Cloud-Hosted Dataset: The dataset is stored and accessed from the cloud for seamless integration.

**Technologies Used**

- Programming Languages: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
